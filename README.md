### Noyying

"Noyce is a maze." How many times have you heard this statement on campus? Well the answer for me is too many.

We are trying to solve Grinnell's Science Center's problems with technology (its what Robert Noyce would have wanted).

Presenting you Noyying: A map application that helps with route planning in Robert Noyce Science Center and making the building a bit less annoying.

This is the codebase for the RESTful API system of Noyying built with `Spring Framework` on top of Java, employing `Dijkstra's Algorithm` for shortest route finding between nodes in a graph.

#### Installation

Clone the codebase to your machine to try it out:

```bash
gh repo clone avaashh/noyying-backend
```
